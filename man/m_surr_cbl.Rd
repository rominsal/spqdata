\title{A funcion for creating m-surroudings from polygonal
       features maximizing the common borderline}
\usage{
m_surr_cbl(x = x, m = m, control = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{input sf object with polygons or multipolygons features}

\item{m}{length of m-surrounding}

\item{s}{maximum overlap between any two m-surroundings}

\item{control}{Argumento opcional. Por definir}
}
\value{
REPASAR A list with four matrices: an m-surrounding matrix, named mh,
        whose rows correspond to the m-surroundings; a matrix, named mhs,
        containing the m-surroundings with maximum overlapping of s; a matrix including
        the length of borderlines between m-surroundings and a distance matrix,
        named dtmh, whose rows correspond to distance between the elements
        of m-surroundings.
}
\description{
This function obtains the m-surroundings by
             choosing the m-1 neighboring polygons. If there are more than
             (m-1) first order neighbors the algorithm chooses the polygons with the
             longest borderlines.
             **VIP** If there are less than (m-1) first order neighbors the
             corresponding m-surrounding is filled with second order
             neighbors in increasing order between centroid distances.
